    "question": "A cloud administrator wants to migrate a virtual machine using VMware vSphere vMotion from their on-premises data center to their VMware Cloud on AWS software-defined data center (SDDC), using an existing private line to the cloud SDDC. Which two requirements must be met before the migration can occur? (Choose two.)",
    "choices": [
      "The versions of VMware vSphere need to match between the on-premises data center and the cloud SDDC.",
      "A Layer 2 connection is configured between the on-premises data center and the cloud SDDC.",
      "AWS Direct Connect is configured between the on-premises data center and the cloud SDDC.",

      "Cluster-level Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) is configured in the on-premises data center and the cloud SDDC."
    ],
    "correct": [1, 4],
    "explanation": "A Layer 2 connection ensures network identity preservation during vMotion, and EVC ensures CPU compatibility."
